Pharmacy deserts, areas with inadequate access to essential drug store services, pose significant healthcare challenges as [closures](https://toronto.citynews.ca/2023/10/17/rite-aids-bankruptcy-plan-stirs-worries-of-new-pharmacy-deserts/) affect low-income neighborhoods. A lack of pharmacies can hinder medication access, medication adherence, affecting patient health and increasing the already high healthcare costs in Canada.

In Vancouver, there are pockets of limited pharmacy access in the city's urban and suburban neighborhoods, underlining the pressing need for more equitable healthcare. This may also be affected by availability of transit or walkability of the neighbourhoods, particularly for those with mobility issues.

Solutions like [telepharmacy](https://www.bcpharmacists.org/community-telepharmacy) for medication orders and patient communication are gaining ground and can reshape medication access, particularly in underserved, rural, and remote areas, providing vital pharmaceutical services.
